## Project Description:

Developed "Swoleboi," a sophisticated real-time exercise pose analysis and tracking application, utilizing Python and an array of libraries including Tkinter for the GUI, OpenCV for video capture and image processing, and MediaPipe for advanced pose estimation.

## Key Features:

- Real-Time Pose Detection: Integrated MediaPipe's pose solution to accurately detect and track user poses in real-time, facilitating immediate feedback on exercise form and technique.

- Interactive GUI: Designed and implemented a user-friendly interface using Tkinter and CustomTkinter, featuring dynamic displays for exercise stage, repetition count, and confidence probability, enhancing user engagement and experience.

- Exercise Stage Classification: Employed machine learning techniques to classify exercise stages (e.g., "up" and "down" phases in a deadlift) with high precision, using a pre-trained model serialized with Pickle for efficient loading and inference.

- Repetition Counting: Incorporated logic to count exercise repetitions based on the transition between exercise stages, providing users with quantitative feedback on their workout progress.

- Robust Error Handling: Implemented error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth operation, including camera initialization checks and safeguards against processing failures.
